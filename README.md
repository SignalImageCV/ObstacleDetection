# ObstacleDetection
A Stationary and Moving Obstacle Segmentation System


An approach for modeling the 3D dynamic driving scene using a set of variable-size planes and arrays of voxels. 3D-LIDAR and GPS-aided
Inertial Navigation System (INS) data are used as inputs. The set of variablesize planes are used to estimate and model non-planar grounds, such as undulated
roads and curved uphill - downhill ground surfaces. The voxel pattern representation is used to efficiently model obstacles, which are further segmented into: static obstacles and moving obstacles
